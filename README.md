## Description

The deployed web application can be found at: https://cascadecolin.github.io/Code-Quiz/

The purpose of this application is to allow users to take a quiz that asks questions about JavaScript.  The quiz is timed, starting at 75 seconds.  If the user gets a question wrong then 10 seconds are reduced from the timer.  The final score is determined by the value of time remaining upon answering the last question.  If a user is struggling and ends up running the time to 0 or less, their score will be reflected as such (negative scores are allowed).  In any of those outcomes, the user will be prompted to input their initials to save for the highscores.  This is stored in local storage and can be recalled by the user by clicking the "highscores" button in the top left of the page.

The user is allowed to take the quiz as many times as they would like and can store a new highscore with each round.  This encourages them to keep trying for a highscore while learning more about JavaScript!
